# Ardo-hot-coms
This is a script I put together so that I could use AHK to talk to my Arduino Uno over coms, to run an I2C LCD. There is already a project out there for comunicating over coms, but it only worked for a preset value in HEX. I updated it with a ascii to hex converter and added all the necessary bits to make it work over COMs. links to resources below.

It took me forever to get this to work but I have combined a few existing projects to get this to work properly. I understand that It could use a lot of cleanup work, but It works for now.
